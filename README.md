//--POMODORO APP--//
By Team Algorithm 2019

---

//--SHORT DESCRIPTION--//
The following is the work of Team Algorithm and its main purpose is
to allow the user such as programmist to take a break and ease their stress.
The website implements a "Pomodore technique" to do so.
It allows user to manually adjust the timer corresponding to the task that he currently performs.
Once the countdown is over, the user is notified by alert sound.
He is then prompted to choose among four options: youtube videos with body exercises, play Trivia game or check traffic in the city. In this simple technique the user distracts himself for a while from the activity and focuses on something else instead. This can has a positive impact on his wellbeing.
The app additionally offers weather info, clock, and news - these are acquired using API systems.
